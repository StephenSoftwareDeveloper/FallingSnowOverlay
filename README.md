# FallingSnowOverlay

A combination of JavaScript canvas and drawing overlays after it prompts you for a url image address (e.g. right click an image on the web and select "copy image address"). The snow falling is 2D but simulates 3D perspective through math where size correlates to velocity of falling so some snow flakes appear further away and others closer.
